        "text": "As an air and water sign, Libra and Pisces can use their strengths to navigate challenges together. They are both intelligent and can engage in stimulating conversations. However, confrontation isn’t their strong suit. When communication falters, it can create a rift in their relationship. Libra’s occasional manipulative tendencies may not sit well with sensitive Pisces, who can become frustrated by Libra’s need for clarity.
