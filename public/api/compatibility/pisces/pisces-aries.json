Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and Pisces is the last, so their differences are clear. Yet, despite these contrasts, Aries and Pisces compatibility can work. Aries charges headfirst into everything, while Pisces loves the thrill of the unexpected. Their shared risk-taking balances the relationship. Plus, as neighbors in the zodiac, Aries, the fire sign, naturally protects the gentle Pisces, building trust between them."

        "text": "Aries and Pisces will need to put in extra effort to sync up in the bedroom. Aries shouldn't rush Pisces, who needs time to feel comfortable. At the same time, Pisces should step outside their comfort zone and tap into their creativity to engage Aries, rather than holding back. Aries is a highly sensual sign, and their needs might seem overwhelming at times, but this difference doesn't have to shake the relationship."
