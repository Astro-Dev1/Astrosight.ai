        "text": "When it comes to intimacy, Gemini and Capricorn are complete opposites. Capricorn tends to be more reserved and may feel uncomfortable with Gemini's adventurous spirit, especially when it comes to trying out new experiences. For their sexual compatibility to flourish, Gemini will need to help Capricorn relax and open up to new ideas, letting go of their practical mindset. Attraction can also be an issue; Gemini might find Capricorn a bit stiff, while Capricorn may see Gemini as too unconventional. Even if there’s some initial intrigue, Gemini’s lack of deep emotional engagement can be a turnoff for the more serious Capricorn, leading to potential boredom in the bedroom."
