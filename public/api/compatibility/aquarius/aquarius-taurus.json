Taurus should embrace a more experimental mindset, while Aquarius may need to tone down their desire for absolute freedom. When they work together, their compatibility can shine. By setting healthy boundaries, Taurus can be the steady “doer,” and Aquarius the imaginative dreamer. However, like oil and water, they may struggle to meet each other’s emotional expectations."
