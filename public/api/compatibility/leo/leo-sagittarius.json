        "text": "Communication is a strong suit for Leo and Sagittarius, largely because they both recognize the unique value they bring to the relationship. Their mutual admiration often shines through their actions rather than words. While they can discuss their interests with great enthusiasm for hours, they also seem to have a knack for reading each other’s minds. Their comfort with one another allows them to be their authentic selves without feeling pressured to fit into a mold. However, there may be moments when Sagittarius finds Leo’s boastfulness a bit much, or Leo gets annoyed when Sagittarius seems to brush things off. Luckily, resolving these misunderstandings comes easily to them, given their innate connection."
